# All About Type
I can't contain my love for letters and type, so I made this repo to contain some of it for me.

## General Definitions
**Typeface**: The name for a family of type (e.g., Futura)

**Font**: A family member of a typeface (e.g., Futura Book)

**Lettering**: Type that is illustrated, designed, or otherwise created without using fonts

## Quick Guides + Cheatsheets
+ **[Typography in Ten Minutes](http://practicaltypography.com/typography-in-ten-minutes.html)**: "This is a bold claim, but I stand be­hind it: if you learn and fol­low these five ty­pog­ra­phy rules, you will be a bet­ter ty­pog­ra­pher than 95% of pro­fes­sional writ­ers and 70% of pro­fes­sional de­sign­ers."
+ **[All of the Fonts You'll Ever Need](http://kadavy.net/allthefontsyoulleverneed-kadavy.pdf)**: "If these were the only fonts you ever used, everything would be just fine."
